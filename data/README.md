# WIP

For the time being you can:

* Create a new dataset
* Run the queries from this directory in the numbered order replacing
  `christoph-uuid-sandbox.githubstats` with the dataset name you just created. You'll have to
  materialize the result of each query for use in the subsequent query. Refer to the subsequent
  query for table names.

**Running all queries will cost you around $20.**

Will add more exhaustive documentation and better tooling within this PR.
